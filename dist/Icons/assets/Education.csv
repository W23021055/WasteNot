landfills,Landfills,"Landfills are large, carefully managed areas where our waste is stored. Learn how they work, what problems they cause, and what we can do to reduce landfill waste.","When we throw something away, it often ends up in a landfill. Modern landfills are lined with protective layers to prevent toxic liquids from leaking into the ground. They also use pipes to collect gases like methane.","Even with these safety measures, landfills can harm the environment. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, and valuable materials are lost when items are buried instead of reused or recycled.","You can help by recycling more, composting food scraps, and buying products with less packaging. Every small action reduces how much ends up in landfills — and helps keep our planet clean and healthy!"
composting,Composting,"Composting turns organic waste into natural fertilizer for soil.","Composting is a natural way to recycle food scraps and yard waste into rich soil. It helps plants grow and reduces the amount of waste sent to landfills.","When composting, materials like fruit peels, coffee grounds, and grass clippings break down into a nutrient-rich soil additive.","You can compost at home in a small bin or in your garden to reduce waste and support a greener planet."
greenhouse-gases,Greenhouse Gases,"Greenhouse gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, affecting climate change.","Gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide are released from human activities such as driving cars, farming, and burning fossil fuels.","These gases trap heat from the sun, causing the planet’s temperature to rise — a process known as the greenhouse effect.","Reducing energy use, planting trees, and using renewable energy sources can all help lower greenhouse gas emissions."
recycling,Recycling,"Recycling helps conserve resources and energy by turning old materials into new products.","When we recycle items like paper, plastic, glass, and metal, we reduce the need to extract new raw materials.","This saves energy, reduces pollution, and keeps waste out of landfills.","Always check local recycling rules to make sure you’re sorting items correctly — every small effort counts!"
types-of-food,Types of Food,"Different types of food have unique effects on the environment and our health.","Fruits and vegetables generally have lower environmental impacts than meat and dairy products.","Producing meat often requires more water and land, and generates more greenhouse gases.","Eating more plant-based meals can help the planet and improve personal health."
sustainability,Sustainability,"Sustainability means meeting our needs without harming future generations.","Sustainable living involves using fewer resources, reducing waste, and protecting ecosystems.","Small changes, like using reusable bags, conserving energy, and supporting eco-friendly products, make a big difference.","Together, our daily choices can create a cleaner, fairer, and more sustainable world."
